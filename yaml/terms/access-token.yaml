      Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An
      access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the
      client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens
      represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the
      resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization
      server.
      
      The token may denote an identifier used to retrieve the authorization
      information or may self-contain the authorization information in a
      verifiable manner (i.e., a token string consisting of some data and a
      signature).  Additional authentication credentials, which are beyond
      the scope of this specification, may be required in order for the
      client to use a token.
      
      The access token provides an abstraction layer, replacing different
      authorization constructs (e.g., username and password) with a single
      token understood by the resource server.  This abstraction enables
      issuing access tokens more restrictive than the authorization grant
      used to obtain them, as well as removing the resource server's need
      to understand a wide range of authentication methods.
      
      Access tokens can have different formats, structures, and methods of
      utilization (e.g., cryptographic properties) based on the resource
      server security requirements.  Access token attributes and the
      methods used to access protected resources are beyond the scope of
      this specification and are defined by companion specifications such
      as [RFC6750].
