      DPoP introduces the concept of a DPoP proof, which is a JWT created by the client and sent with an HTTP request
      using the DPoP header field. Each HTTP request requires a unique DPoP proof.
      
      A valid DPoP proof demonstrates to the server that the client holds the private key that was used to sign the
      DPoP proof JWT. This enables authorization servers to bind issued tokens to the corresponding public key
      (as described in Section 5) and enables resource servers to verify the key-binding of tokens that it
      receives (see Section 7.1), which prevents said tokens from being used by any entity that does not
      have access to the private key.
      
      The DPoP proof demonstrates possession of a key and, by itself, is not an authentication or access control
      mechanism. When presented in conjunction with a key-bound access token as described in Section 7.1,
      the DPoP proof provides additional assurance about the legitimacy of the client to present the access token.
      However, a valid DPoP proof JWT is not sufficient alone to make access control decisions.
